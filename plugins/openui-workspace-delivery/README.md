# OpenUI Workspace Delivery

This folder is the canonical pure-skills packet for OpenUI MCP Studio.

The canonical public root for the product still lives at the repo root:
`../../README.md` plus `../../manifest.yaml`.
The canonical machine-readable descriptor for the pure-MCP lane now lives at
`../../server.json`.

It is meant to teach an agent four things without sending the reviewer back to
repo-root docs first:

- how to install the local MCP server
- how to attach it to OpenHands or OpenClaw
- which UI-generation tools are safe to use first
- what the shortest proof loop looks like

## Included files

- `SKILL.md`
- `manifest.yaml`
- `references/INSTALL.md`
- `references/OPENHANDS_MCP_CONFIG.json`
- `references/OPENCLAW_MCP_CONFIG.json`
- `references/CAPABILITIES.md`
- `references/DEMO.md`
- `references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## Truth boundary

- this packet maps to a ClawHub lane that is `listed_live`, but the current page
  still shows `Moderation verdict: suspicious` and
  `Detected: suspicious.llm_suspicious`
- the OpenHands lane is real through `OpenHands/extensions#161`, and the
  current GitHub state is `OPEN / REVIEW_REQUIRED / BLOCKED`
- the Goose lane is real through `block/Agent-Skills#25`, and the current
  visible blocker is upstream security review after validation passed
- the agent-skill index lane is real through
  `heilcheng/awesome-agent-skills#181`, and the current visible blocker is
  upstream preview authorization rather than a missing repo packet
- it is still not a live vendor marketplace listing
- it does not claim a hosted runtime
- it does not claim vendor approval, a trust-cleared ClawHub result, or an
  official registry listing

Use the host configs and proof loop in `references/` first. Treat the older
`commands/` and `samples/` files as supporting material, not as the primary
reviewer packet.
